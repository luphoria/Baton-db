      What is Baton?
      Baton is for windows batch files, it creates a function like python's import
      function so you can import handy commands. Baton is currently in early developement
      stages so if you find a bug or have a suggestion please make an issue on the repository.
      
      [NOTE] Baton currently requires <span style="text-decoration: underline;">.NET core</span> to work.
