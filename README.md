Baton is for windows batch files, it creates a function like python's import
function so you can import handy commands. Baton is currently in early developement
stages so if you find a bug or have a suggestion please make an issue on the repository.

Do you want to submit your own function? No problem, first make sure your function
hasn't already been made over at the website. Next private message me on discord (Mjni#3250)
with your function and a short description of what it does.
